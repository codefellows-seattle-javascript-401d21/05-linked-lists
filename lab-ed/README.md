# Lab 05 Linked Lists

The insertHead function has an arity of 1. It expects to be passed a node value as it's argument and uses the Node object in Nd to create a new node at the head of the linked list.
Access the method by requiring in '/lib/sll' as a const and calling constName.insertHead.
To test using Jest, install jest from the command line if not already installed: 'npm i -D jest' to set it as a dev dependency or just 'npm i' to have npm read package.json for the jest dependency. To run the tests use the npm test command: 'npm run test'.

The insertEnd function has an arity of 1. It expects to be passed a node value as it's argument and uses the Node object in Nd to create a new node at the end of the linked list.
Access the method by requiring in '/lib/sll' as a const and calling constName.insertEnd.
To test using Jest, install jest from the command line if not already installed: 'npm i -D jest' to set it as a dev dependency or just 'npm i' to have npm read package.json for the jest dependency. To run the tests use the npm test command: 'npm run test'.

The remove offset function has an arity of 1. It expects to be passed an offset value as it's argument, 1 thru n, where 1 is the head node and uses the Node object in Nd to create a new node at the end of the linked list.
Access the method by requiring in '/lib/sll' as a const and calling constName.insertEnd.
To test using Jest, install jest from the command line if not already installed: 'npm i -D jest' to set it as a dev dependency or just 'npm i' to have npm read package.json for the jest dependency. To run the tests use the npm test command: 'npm run test'.
