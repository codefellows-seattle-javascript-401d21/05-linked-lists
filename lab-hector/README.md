# Lab Singly Linked List Data Structure

### Feature Tasks
- Implement a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structure
- Implement insertHead(value), insertEnd(value), reverse(), and remove(offset) methods to the SLL prototype
- In a comment within each function, note the it's Big-O runtime
##### Stretch:
- Implement findNthNodeFromEnd(n) as a method on the SLL prototype
takes n as an input/argument, representing the offset from the end to return
- Returns the nth node from the end (opposite of head) of the list
