# Nd Module

The Nd Module contains the following list of functionality:

  1. The nd module contains the constructor to build Node objects for insertion into the linked lists. This constructor builds an object with a value property which is instantiated to an input value and a next property which is instantiated to "null"

          Big O: O(1)

          The required input(s) for this method are: 

            A data value for use in Node object instantiation.

          This method is tested for input verification, input validation, and output validation

# Single Linked List Module

The SLL Module contains the following list of functionality:

  1. The Single Linked List constructor builds an empty list item containing two properties head which represents the beginning of the list and is instantiated to "null" and lLen which represents the current list length and is instantiated to "0".

          Big O: O(1)  

          The required input(s) for this method are: 
        
            This functionality requires no inputs.

          This method is tested for input verification, input validation, and output validation.

  2. The insertHead Method of the SLL class uses the Nd Module to create a new Node and adds it to the head of the list. It accomplishes this by setting the next property on the new object to the current head and changing the head property of the list to the new Node object. Once this is completed it increments the lLen property of the list object.

          Big O: O(1)

          The required input(s) for this method are:

            This functionality requires a data value for use in Node object instantiation.

          This method is tested for input verification, input validation, output verification, and output validation.

  3. The insertTail Method of the SLL class uses the Nd Module to create a new Node and adds it to the end of the list. It accomplishes this by iterating to the end of the list then changing the last item's next value from "null" to the new Node object. Once this is completed it increments the lLen property of the list object.

          Big O: O(n)

          The required input(s) for this method are:

            This functionality requires a data value for use in Node object instantiation.

          This method is tested for input verification, input validation, output verification, and output validation.

  4. The remove Method of the SLL class iterates through the list to the nth object and removes it from the list. It accomplishes this by saving the current module as the previous module just before each iteration so that it can set the previous Node's next value to the next value of the node to be removed. Once this has been completed it decrements the lLen property of the list object.

          Big O: O(n)

          The required input(s) for this method are:

            This functionality requires a number value representing the list item to be removed.
        
          This method is tested for input verification, input validation, output verification, and output validation.

  5. The reverse Method of the SLL class reverses the list order. It accomplishes this through the use of a previous, current, next cycle where it stores the current node's next value in a next node variable before setting it to the previous node then stores the current node with the new link in the previous node variable and iterating to the next node variable.

          Big O: O(n)

          The required input(s) for this method are:

            This functionality requires no inputs.

          This method is tested for input verification, input validation, and output validation.

  6. The findNthNode Method of the SLL class finds the Nth node from the beginning of the list and returns it. It accomplishes this by iterating to the Nth position of the list starting at the list head object.

          Big O: O(n)

          The required input(s) for this method are:

            This functionality requires a number value representing the list item to be retrieved.

          This method is tested for input verification, input validation, and output validation.

  7. The findNthFromLastNode Method of the SLL class finds the Nth node from the end of the list and returns it. It accomplishes this by first subtracting "n" from the lLen value of the list object, then iterates to the object at that position and returns it.

          Big O: O(n)

          The required input(s) for this method are:

            This functionality requires a number value representing the list item to be retrieved, counting from the end of the list.

          This method is tested for input verification, input validation, and output validation.
